# **Shalom shalom**

These are my various configuration files, enjoy looking at them.

Colors for the majority of software used are supposed to be generated by pywal, don't expect anything to look pretty without any effort on your part/if you don't already use pywal.

## **Arch Installation**
I've finalized my install script, it's mostly personalized, meaning it will install my usual hyprland setup and use my configuration files. 
So besides partitioning, don't expect it to be completely flexible (though the script will be friendly for Nvidia users).
\
\
Inspect the script [here](https://git.sr.ht/~_00ein00_/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh), those that want to try it out can run:
```bash
curl 'https://git.sr.ht/~_00ein00_/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh' > install.sh && chmod +x install.sh
```
to retrieve the script 

and:
```bash
./install.sh
```
to run it.
