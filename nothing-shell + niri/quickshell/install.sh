# nothingshell — the parts of installing it that a clone cannot do by itself.
#
# Cloning this repository into ~/.config/quickshell/nothingshell IS the installation: the tree is
# the quickshell config, the shaders come baked, there is nothing to build. What is left over is
# everything outside the tree — the packages, the one `source =` line in hyprland.conf, and
# starting the thing — and that is all this script does. It is a convenience, not a package
# manager: run it or do the four steps by hand from the README, the result is the same.
#
#   ./install.sh              ask before each step
#   ./install.sh -y           assume yes (also what happens with no terminal to ask at)
#   ./install.sh --no-deps    skip the packages, do the rest
#   ./install.sh --no-start   install, but do not launch the shell
#
# Never run this with sudo. It writes into your home, and a root-owned ~/.config is a mess to
# undo. The one part that does need root — the login screen — is a separate script you run
# yourself afterwards; it is only mentioned at the end here, never invoked.
